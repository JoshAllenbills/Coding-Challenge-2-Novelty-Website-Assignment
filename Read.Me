Objective: Your task is to create a novelty website that has no practical purpose other than to entertain, confuse, or amuse users. Think about websites like "Zombo.com" or "Pug in a Rug"—sites that don't necessarily make sense but are fun to explore.
This assignment will challenge your creativity while reinforcing your skills in HTML and CSS. You’ll practice creating a unique user experience using the web technologies you've learned so far.

Requirements:
Concept and Theme:
Design a simple, quirky, or absurd website with no real purpose or functionality.
Your website should have an element of humor, confusion, or novelty.
HTML Structure:
The site must be structured with HTML elements.
Include at least 3 sections (e.g., header, main content, footer).
Use headings, paragraphs, and lists appropriately.
CSS Styling:
Your website must be styled with custom CSS to create an engaging look.
Implement at least one CSS animation or transition to make an element interactive (e.g., hover effects, color changes, movement).
Use Flexbox for layout to arrange your content in an interesting way.
Design Guidelines:
Incorporate a color palette that matches the theme or absurdity of your website.
Use background images, fonts, and shapes that complement the novelty theme.
Add at least one quirky or confusing feature (e.g., a button that does nothing, an element that changes randomly, or text that scrolls oddly).

Deliverables:
Project Files:
Submit your HTML and CSS files via a GitHub repository in the Google Classroom assignment.
