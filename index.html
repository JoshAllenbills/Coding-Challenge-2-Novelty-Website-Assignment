       <p>Before becoming a household name, Patrick Mahomes served as the third-string quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs during the 2016 season. Drafted as a surprising late-round pick, Mahomes was initially seen as a project player. He spent his rookie year mostly on the bench, observing veteran quarterback Alex Smith and learning the intricacies of the Chiefs’ offense. During this time, Mahomes famously spent hours in the film room, analyzing game footage and developing his unique throwing mechanics, even working on unconventional plays with the practice squad.
    Despite being third on the depth chart, Mahomes made headlines during training camp with his jaw-dropping no-look passes and long throws. Coaches were impressed by his raw talent, leading to speculation that he might see playing time in some of the team’s less critical games. However, Mahomes remained sidelined, watching as the Chiefs made a playoff run. His time as a third-string quarterback ultimately helped him build the resilience and knowledge needed for the breakout season that followed, where he would later redefine the quarterback position in the NFL.
